Autocommit:
          It automatically saves all the changes that are happening in the table.
          initially all the table have a autocommit on as default.
          To turn off the auto commit  we use
          SET AUTOCOMMIT = off
i.e: SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF;

Commit :
        Once we turned off the autocommit to create a save point we use a keyword "COMMIT"
        any changes after this commit can be reverted
        To be save again we need to use "COMMIT" again
i.e: COMMIT;

Rollback :
         We use this keyword to revert all changes that happened after the commit.
i.e: ROLLBACK;

eg:- SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF;
     COMMIT;
     DELETE FROM info
     WHERE id = 1;
     /// TO undo changes ///
     ROLLBACK;
