PRIMARY KEY:
           primary keys are used in a column to make sure that each value in a column is unique and not null.
Note: A table can contain one primary key only.
We can transaction in two methods

Method 1 applying directly:
    Mentioning them explictly them while referencing the data 
eg: CREATE TABLE transactions(
	trabsaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    transcation_amount DECIMAL(3,1) default 0
);

Method 2  using costraint with alter keyword:
    after creating a table and we need to create a default value we can use this Method
eg: ALTER TABLE transaction 
    ADD CONSTRAIN
    PRIMARY KEY(trabsaction_id);


eg:
INSERT INTO transactions
VALUES (1, 2.3),
	   (2, 3.4),        #Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry '1' for key 'transactions.PRIMARY'
       (3, 4.5),
	   (3, 5.6);
SELECT * FROM transactions;
