To select a particular data from the table we use a keyword "SELECT" "*" "FROM" 
which is then followed by the "WHERE".
WHERE is a condition clause which is used to select query based on a condition

i.e SELECT * FROM info
    WHERE id = 1;

We can use multiple operators in where which can match our condition.

/////////////// To select particular column ////////////////////////

In place of * we can use particular column name to select 
i.e SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM info;
