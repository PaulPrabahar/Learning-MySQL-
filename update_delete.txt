/////////////////////// To updata a data /////////////////
we use keyword "UPDATE" followed by the name of the table then
we use "SET" keyword to choose which data need to be modified
and we use "WHERE" if need to updata a particular data.
i.e: UPDATE info
     SET first_name = "puppy"
     WHERE first_name = "paul";

if to set all first_name to "puppy" then
i.e: UPDATE info
     SET first_name = "puppy"

with no where condition it set all the selected data to be "puppy". 

//////////////////////// To delete a data ////////////////////////

To delete a data from a table we use keyword "DELETE" followed by the table name.
i.e: DELETE FROM info;

To delete a particular data we need to use "WHERE" keyword to initiate a condition.
i.e: DELETE FROM info;
     WHERE first_name = "paul";
